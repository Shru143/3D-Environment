# 3D Environment 

## Overview
This project is a **3D Environment** developed using the **Unity Engine**. The project utilizes the **Universal Render Pipeline (URP)**, chosen for its advanced graphics and performance optimizations, to create detailed and visually immersive terrains. The environment not only showcases realistic terrain but also allows the **player to interact** with the environment, including opening doors in houses, using custom scripts.

## Features
- **Terrain Creation**: Designed and sculpted terrain using Unity's built-in terrain tools.
- **Player Interaction**: The player can explore the environment using a custom **PlayerMovement** script, allowing for smooth and responsive movement within the 3D terrain.
- **Interactive Houses**: The environment includes houses where players can open doors, enabled by a custom **Door** script.
- **URP Integration**: Optimized lighting, shadows, and post-processing effects using the Universal Render Pipeline.
- **Textures & Materials**: Applied realistic textures and materials to enhance the environmentâ€™s look and feel.
- **Lighting & Shadows**: Implemented dynamic lighting to create natural day-night cycles and realistic shadow effects.
- **Vegetation & Foliage**: Added trees, grass, and other natural elements to bring life to the environment.
